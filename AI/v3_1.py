### Feqtures:
# 1. also simulate other players' card, done
# 2. take their current betting into account, if big bet, then boost their card or level
#    boost by taking upper subset of simulation result, done
#   2.1 only consider bold-better, for computation efficiency, done
# 3. consider give up cost, done
# 4. set different reaction when win rate is above or below certain threshold, done
# 5. consider the variance of simulation output
# 6. apply kelly criterion
# this version: use expected return method in deciding raisebet target
